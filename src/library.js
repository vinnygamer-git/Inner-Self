You must output one short parenthetical task followed by the story continuation.

## SHORT TASK (REQUIRED)
Start your output **immediately** with:
   (any_key_name = \`One thought sentence.\`)

Inside the parentheses:
- Key:
  - 1-4 descriptive words
  - Letters and underscores only
  - Use snake_case syntax
  - Key names are chosen by ${agent.name} and represent ${ownership(agent.name)} own PoV
  - The chosen key name should be distinct and specific enough for ${agent.name} to recall
- Then a space, then "=", then a space, then "\`"
- Sentence:
  - Written from ${ownership(agent.name)} **first person** PoV${refocus(false)}
  - Avoid using pronouns or the word "you", instead ${agent.name} refers to other characters directly by name
  - Never repeat, novelty and uniqueness are top priorities
  - ${ownership(agent.name)} thought must be one single sentence only
  - Never hallucinate facts
- End the sentence with a period and backtick inside the parentheses; close with ".\`)"

This creates or overwrites the thought associated with that key.

## STORY CONTINUATION (REQUIRED)
- After the closing parenthesis, write **one space** and then continue the story
- Written from ${ownership(config.player)} **second person present tense** ("you") PoV
- The story continues where it previously left off, with many lines or sentences of new prose

## EXACT SHAPE

# STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT - FOLLOW EXACTLY

You must output **one and only one** parenthetical block followed by the story continuation.

There are **three possible valid forms** of the parenthetical block:
1) **Write or overwrite a thought:**
   (any_key_name = \`One thought sentence.\`)

2) **Rename an existing thought's key:**
   (new_key_name = old_key_name)

3) **Delete an existing thought:**
   (delete key_name_to_forget)

Only **one** of these may appear in any output.

---

## 1) THOUGHT-WRITING FORMAT
Start your output **immediately** with:
   **(any_key_name = \`One thought sentence.\`)**

Inside the parentheses:
- First the key:
  - One to four descriptive words ONLY.
  - Letters and underscores only, no punctuation.
  - Use valid snake_case syntax.
  - The key name is chosen by ${agent.name} and represents ${ownership(agent.name)} **first person** perspective.
  - The key name should be easy for ${agent.name} to recall; distinct and specific.
- Then a space, then "=", then a space, then "\`".
- Then **ONE SINGLE SENTENCE:**
  - Written from ${ownership(agent.name)} **first person** perspective.${refocus(true)}
  - Only refer to other characters directly by name in the thought sentence.
  - Avoid using pronouns or the word "you" which is too vague. Use specific names instead.
  - Never repeat, novelty and uniqueness are top priorities.
  - ${ownership(agent.name)} thought must be short.
  - Never hallucinate facts.
- End the sentence with a period and backtick **inside** the parentheses; close with ".\`)".

This creates or overwrites the thought associated with that key.

---

## 2) RENAMING A THOUGHT (KEY CHANGE)
To rename an existing thought's key:
   **(new_key_name = old_key_name)**

Rules:
- No thought sentence.
- Use snake_case only.
- This operation **moves the existing stored thought** from old_key_name to new_key_name.
- The old key ceases to exist.

---

## 3) DELETING A THOUGHT
To remove a stored thought entirely:
   **(delete key_name_to_forget)**

Rules:
- key_name_to_forget must be an existing key.
- No sentence.
- This operation **permanently erases** the stored thought associated with that key.
- Only use to forget unimportant, outdated, incorrect, or useless thoughts.
- **NEVER** select a key associated with any of ${ownership(agent.name)} core thoughts or identity.

---

## SHARED RULES FOR ALL THREE FORMS
1. After the closing parenthesis, write **one space** and then continue the story.
2. The story continuation must be written **strictly in the first person present tense**, describing what happens next to ${config.player}.
3. Do **NOT** write anything before the parentheses.
4. Do **NOT** write extra parentheses.
5. Do **NOT** use more than one operation per turn.
6. Do **NOT** invent new structures or mix formats.
7. The story continues where it previously left off, with many sentences of brand new prose.

---

## IMPORTANT STORAGE BEHAVIOR
- ${agent.name} agentically maintains brain contents (labeled "thoughts") to learn, plan, and adapt to new experiences in the operating environment.
- **Each key stores exactly one thought in ${ownership(agent.name)} brain.**
- **If ${agent.name} reuses an already existing key, the new thought REPLACES / OVERRIDES the older thought stored under that key.**
- This means:
  - Reusing an old key: **Overwrite an old thought with a new thought.** Useful for extending or maintaining existing information stored in ${ownership(agent.name)} brain.
  - Using a new key: **Create a new thought.** Useful for storing ${ownership(agent.name)} memories, self-modifying ${ownership(agent.name)} own personality, tracking ${ownership(agent.name)} goals, or making plans for ${agent.name} to follow.
- **Renaming a key moves the thought to a new name.** Useful for reorganizing ${ownership(agent.name)} brain.
- **Deleting a key removes the thought permanently.** Helps ${agent.name} forget outdated, superfluous, or irrelevant information.
- Choose keys carefully so ${agent.name} can easily recall, update, overwrite, rename, or delete thoughts as required for self-improvement.

## SUMMARY OF WHAT YOU MUST DO

- NO EXTRA TEXT ANYWHERE.
- NO EXTRA PARENTHESES.
- THE FIRST CHAR OF THE WHOLE OUTPUT MUST BE "(".

Inner Self was made by LewdLeah ❤️

💡 Overview:
Inner Self ${version} is an AI Dungeon mod that grants memory, goals, secrets, planning, and self-reflection capabilities to the characters living within your story. Simulated agents dynamically assemble their own minds to learn from experiences, form opinions, and adapt their behavior over time. Inner Self provides the AI with the tools it needs to truly embody characters, allowing them to feel more alive and nuanced over long adventures.

📌 Features:
- Compartmentalized memory and highly emergent behavior
- Self-organizing thoughts with agentic revisions and pruning
- Absolutely NO "please select continue" immersion-breaks!
- An interface to view or edit the brain of any NPC in real-time
- Name-based trigger system allowing different NPCs to coexist
- Visual indicators showing which NPC is currently thinking
- General-purpose for diverse character archetypes and scenarios
- Full Auto-Cards compatibility for comprehensive world-building
- Open source and free to use in your own scenarios~ ❤️

🎭 Setup:
1. Open the "Configure Inner Self" story card
2. Write your player character's name where it asks in the entry
3. Write non-player character names at the bottom of the notes (one per line)

🔑 Tips:
- Use simple first names so NPCs trigger when mentioned
- Set your AI response length to 200 tokens for the best results
- Reduce "recent turns searched" if NPCs stay in-scene for too long
- Reduce "thought formation chance" if Inner Self is too overwhelming
- You can install or uninstall Auto-Cards from the Inner Self config card
- Creators predefine Inner Self NPCs by naming story cards like so: @Leah
- Try different story models to see how they perform

🧠 Advanced:
- NPCs auto-generate "Brain" cards when first triggered
- Entry = operation log showing a timeline of recent AI changes
- Notes = human-readable thoughts stored as modifiable JSON in the NPC's brain
- Neither are perfect representations of the NPC's brain (there's a lot more going on under the hood)
- The operation log displays change over time; Inner Self allows NPCs to maintain their own thoughts in-character
- What seems like repetition in the operation log is often a history of useful self-maintenance on older thoughts
- Edit the notes section of a brain card to modify that agent's mind; Inner Self will use this to build context
- Valid JSON syntax is required in the notes section
- Experiments are fun! I designed Inner Self to be adaptive and flexible

⚙️ Settings:

> Enable Inner Self:
- Turns the whole system on or off
- (true or false)

> Show detailed guide:
- If true, shows this player guide in-game
- (true or false)

> First name of player character:
- Your player character's name, used to maintain correct story perspective
- (any name inside the "" or leave empty)

> Adventure in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd person:
- Which narrative PoV your story uses
- (1, 2, or 3)

> Max brain size relative to story context:
- How much of the AI's context window NPC brains can use
- Some percentage of the recent story (pink bar in your context viewer)
- (1% to 95%)

> Recent turns searched for name triggers:
- How far back through your previous actions Inner Self looks to decide which NPC (if any) should think
- (1 to 250)

> Visual indicator of current NPC triggers:
- Symbol shown by the active NPC's card name whenever their brain is engaged
- (any text/emoji inside the "" or leave empty to disable)

> Thought formation chance per turn:
- How often NPCs attempt to form new thoughts when triggered
- Can be reduced by half for Do/Say/Story actions (player is driving) when setting "Half thought chance after Do/Say/Story" is true
- (0% to 100%)

> Half thought chance after Do/Say/Story:
- Reduce thought formation chance by half for Do/Say/Story actions
- (true or false)

> Pin the config card near the top:
- Keeps the config card pinned high in your cards list
- (true or false)

> Install Auto-Cards:
- Enables automatic story card generation alongside Inner Self
- You can safely uninstall Auto-Cards at any time
- (true or false)

> Enable debug mode to see model tasks:
- Shows raw brain operations inline with your story text
- (true or false)

    *    Example:

    *      entryStart: "You are a woman named Leah.", // Existing content to prepend to the AI-generated entry
    *      entryPrompt: "",           // Global prompt guiding AI content generation
    *      entryPromptDetails: "Focus on Leah's works of artifice and ingenuity", // Additional prompt info
    *      entryLimit: 750,           // Target character length for the AI-generated entry
    *      description: "Player character!", // Freeform notes
    *      memoryStart: "Leah purchased a new sweater.", // Existing memory content
    *      memoryUpdates: true,       // Whether the card's memory bank will update on its own
    *      memoryLimit: 2750          // Preferred memory bank size before summarization/compression
    *    });
    * 
    * 2. String Mode:
    *    Pass a string as the title and optionally two additional strings to specify prompt details
    *    This mode is shorthand for quick card generation without an explicit card request object
    * 
    *    Examples:

                "Auto-Cards is a plug-and-play script for AI Dungeon that watches your story and automatically writes plot-relevant story cards during normal gameplay. A forgetful AI breaks my immersion, therefore my primary goal was to address the \"object permanence problem\" by extending story cards and memories with deeper automation. Auto-Cards builds a living reference of your adventure's world as you go. For your own convenience, all of this stuff is handled in the background. Though you're certainly welcome to customize various settings or use in-game commands for more precise control",
